Case 1 (s1.txt):
This dataset might have evenly distributed clusters with distinct centroids.
The K-means algorithm should be able to identify these clusters accurately.
Visual inspection will help confirm if the algorithm successfully identifies the clusters and their centroids.

Case 2 (s2.txt):
If this dataset contains clusters with different densities or sizes, the centroids might not accurately represent the cluster centers.
K-means might struggle to capture clusters with varying densities effectively.
We need to check if the centroids are positioned at meaningful locations and if the clusters are properly separated.

Case 3 (s3.txt):
If this dataset contains clusters with irregular shapes or overlapping regions, K-means might not perform well.
The centroids might be placed in regions with high data density, but they might not accurately represent the true cluster centers.
Visual inspection will help determine if the clusters are cohesive and if the centroids capture the cluster centers well.

Case 4 (s4.txt):
If this dataset contains noisy data or outliers, K-means might produce suboptimal results.
Outliers might affect the positions of centroids and lead to incorrect cluster assignments.
We need to assess if the centroids are influenced by outliers and if they represent meaningful cluster centers.
