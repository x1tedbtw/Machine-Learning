// Comparison with previous regression //

Coefficients: Mixed signs, both positive and negative
Intercept: Higher (around 68.294)
R-squared (Test): Higher (around 0.5995)
Mean Absolute Error: Lower (around 4.2228)
Standard Deviation of Errors: Higher (around 4.2102)

// CONCLUSION //

- The current regression model, using health-related factors,
shows better predictive performance with higher R-squared and lower Mean Absolute Error.
- It has a higher intercept, indicating a higher baseline life expectancy.
- Coefficients in the current model have mixed signs, suggesting varied relationships with life expectancy,
while the previous model had positive coefficients for all features.
